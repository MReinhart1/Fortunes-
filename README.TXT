Happiness is programming
Patience is a virtue 
Success follows hard work 
Your fortune lies in another cookie 
prosperity is the best revenge 
A beautiful, smart, and loving person will be coming into your life
A dubious friend may be an enemy in camouflage
A feather in the hand is better than a bird in the air
A fresh start will put you on your way
A friend asks only for your time not your money
A friend is a present you give yourself
